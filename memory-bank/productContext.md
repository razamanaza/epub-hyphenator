# Product Context: EPUB Hyphenation Tool

## Why This Tool Exists

EPUB files are widely used for e-books and digital publications, but many EPUB creation tools don't include proper hyphenation. This leads to poor text flow and readability, especially on smaller screens or when text is justified. Manual hyphenation is time-consuming and error-prone, particularly for long documents.

## Problems Solved

### Reading Experience Issues

- **Poor text wrapping**: Words that don't fit on a line break awkwardly or extend beyond screen boundaries
- **Justification problems**: Unhyphenated text creates large gaps in justified layouts
- **Mobile readability**: Small screens exacerbate text flow issues without hyphenation

### Content Creation Challenges

- **Manual labor**: Adding hyphens manually to entire books is impractical
- **Inconsistency**: Different authors/editors use different hyphenation rules
- **Language complexity**: Proper hyphenation requires language-specific rules

### Publishing Workflow Gaps

- **Tool limitations**: Many EPUB creation tools lack built-in hyphenation
- **Post-processing needs**: Publishers need easy ways to enhance existing EPUB files
- **Quality standards**: Professional publications require proper text formatting

## Target Users

### Self-Publishers

Authors and indie publishers who want to improve their EPUB formatting without complex software.

### Content Creators

Bloggers, educators, and content creators who distribute materials in EPUB format.

### Publishers
