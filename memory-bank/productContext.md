# EPUB Hyphenator - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem

EPUB files often lack proper hyphenation, leading to poor typography and reduced readability, especially in justified text layouts. This is particularly problematic for:

- **Print-on-demand books** where typography quality directly impacts sales
- **Academic publications** where readability affects comprehension
- **Digital reading experiences** where poor formatting can cause user frustration
- **Multi-language content** where hyphenation patterns differ significantly

### The Solution

EPUB Hyphenator provides a simple, web-based solution for applying professional-grade hyphenation to EPUB files without requiring specialized typography software or technical expertise.
